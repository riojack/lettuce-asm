Receiving Data from a Peripheral Over COM

  Devices must first be initialized in SIO.

  When a device is ready to send data to the system, it will first send a hardware interrupt to the system.  If the
  system is able to receive data from the peripheral, the system will then read a block of data from the device and
  store it in a buffer.  If the system is not able to receive data, the system will set a value in PFLG.


PFLG Layout and Common Reasons (for COM peripherals):

  COM peripheral PLFG values have the following layout:

    COM PORT      REASON PACKET

  The first 8 bits specify the port.  The remaining 24 bits specify a reason.

  Common Reasons (REASON PACKET values):
    0x000 - Unknown flag reason.
